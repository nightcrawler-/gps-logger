<!-- This file has been added to remove the left padding on the Settings Screen.
     The padding has been added by default in API 28, to keep aligned the header text
     with the preferences (the Material Guidelines deepen the topic very well), and to leave space for icons.
     We don't have icons, and we prefer to use all the space available, like on API 27.
